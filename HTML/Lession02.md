# HTML Notes

HTML :- Hyper Text Markup Language

* Used to create the structure of a webpage.
* NO one knows full HTML, we have to study from the documentation.

Good Documentation Website:

## Tricks

* Write the tag without the signs (`< >`) and press `Tab`.
* We can use `lorem<n>` to generate garbage/dummy text.

  * Example: `lorem20`

### Section Heading Tag

* `h<n>`, where `n = 1-6`
* `h1` is the biggest heading.
* `h6` is the smallest heading.
